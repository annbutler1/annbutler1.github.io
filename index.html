               I am from Colorado, and much of who I am is shaped by my love for the 
               outdoors and the arts. I am an avid mountaineer with the goal of completing all
                58 of Colorado’s 14,000-foot peaks; so far, I have summited Bierstadt, Grays, 
                Torreys, Quandary, and Sherman. In the next few years, I also plan to complete 
                all of Colorado’s Via Ferratas. These adventures keep me connected to nature, 
                challenge me physically, and fuel my drive for personal growth.

                At Babson College, where I am a Senior concentrating in Technology Entrepreneurship, 
                I am involved in a variety of leadership and academic roles. I serve as President of the 
                Sustainability Club, Alumni Relations Director for Chi Omega, and Head of Marketing for Peers 
                on Wellness. In addition, I work as an instructor in the ceramics studio, mentoring peers in 
                their artistic practice, and I am a Teaching Assistant for the Foundations of Management 
                and Entrepreneurship (FME) course. These experiences have strengthened my leadership,
                problem-solving, and collaboration skills while allowing me to make an impact on campus. 
                Looking ahead, I plan to pursue a career in consulting after graduation in May, where
                I hope to continue developing as a problem solver. I am excited to return to Denver and 
                begin this next chapter of my life, back in the beautiful Rocky Mountains.

            <h2> My Interests</h2>
            <p> 
                Outside of academics, I am passionate about both mountaineering and ceramics. 
                Climbing Colorado’s 14ers pushes me to test my limits while rewarding me with
                stunning views and a deep appreciation for the outdoors. At the same time,
                ceramics provides me with a creative outlet. I first discovered it at age 15 while 
                helping run a summer ceramics camp as a counselor, and I have been hooked ever since. 
                At Babson, I spend countless hours in the ceramics studio, creating 20 to 25 pieces a semester.
                Bowls are my favorite form to throw on the wheel, but I also enjoy experimenting with new shapes 
                and designs. This semester, I was awarded a Babson Arts grant to create a collection of vases focused 
                on height, allowing me to push my craft further.
                Together, these interests give me balance—mountaineering offers adventure and challenge,
                while ceramics gives me space for creativity and reflection. Both are central to who I am and how
                I connect with the world around me. If you’d like to explore more about Colorado’s mountains,
